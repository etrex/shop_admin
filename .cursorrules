# Development Rules

## Documentation First
1. Before starting any task, always read these documents in order:
   - requirement.md
   - spec.md
   - technical_spec.md
2. After reading the core documents, read task-related files and components

## CSS Rules
1. DO NOT use @import or @use in any CSS/SCSS files
2. All styles should be written directly in the component or in dedicated style files
3. Use scoped styles in Vue components when possible

## Code Organization
1. Keep components focused and single-responsibility
2. Follow Vue 3 Composition API best practices
3. Use clear and descriptive variable and function names
4. Keep consistent naming conventions
5. DO NOT use TypeScript - this project uses pure JavaScript
6. Minimize code reuse - this is a prototype project, prefer direct implementation over shared code
7. This is a frontend-only prototype - all data will be cleared on page refresh
8. DO NOT call any external APIs - this is a standalone frontend prototype

## Version Control
1. Write meaningful commit messages
2. Keep commits atomic and focused
3. Follow conventional commit format
