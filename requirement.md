# Shop Admin System Requirements

## Project Overview
This is an e-commerce back-office system designed to manage inventory, sales, and operations. The system's unique approach focuses on role-based task management rather than traditional category-based navigation.

## Technical Specifications
- Frontend-only demonstration project
- No database required
- All data will be managed in frontend state
- Built for demonstration purposes

## Core Concept
- Task-oriented interface similar to a todo list
- Users can complete their daily work by following their task list
- Eliminates the need to search through different categories to find work items

## User Roles & Role Switching
1. Marketing Staff
2. Customer Service Staff
3. Warehouse Staff
4. Administrators
5. Customers

The system includes a role-switching feature that allows easy demonstration of different user perspectives. Users can freely switch between roles to experience different functionalities and workflows.

## Key Features
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Personalized dashboard for each role
- Task-based workflow management
- Daily task checklist for each role
- Quick role-switching for demonstration purposes
- Mock data for realistic demonstration

## System Philosophy
Instead of organizing features by traditional categories (products, orders, customers), the system organizes tasks by user roles and responsibilities. This approach ensures:
- Clear work responsibilities
- Improved efficiency
- Reduced confusion about task ownership
- Streamlined daily operations
